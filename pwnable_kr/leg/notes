The required input is the sum of the return values of key1, key2 and key3. 
In key1
=======
*In ARM, return value is typically stored in r0.

We look at how pc keeps track. It points to two instructions ahead (i.e 8 bytes in normal mode and 4 bytes in Thumb mode). So here, return value is 0x00008ce4.

In key2
=======
Here, transition to thumb mode takes place due to the instruction bx r6. r6 has pc + 1, i.e 0x00008d04 + 1. Now after that, r6 takes a jump of 4 because pc is moved in it and then 4 is added. So final address is 0x00008d0c.

In key3
=======
The value of lr is the retuen value. And that is the next instruction to execute when key3 returns, i.e 0x00008d80.

Answer is sum of all the return values, i.e 108400.
